---

## 3. Switch Configuration (L3 Switch)

### 3.1 Create VLANs

```bash
conf t
vlan 10
exit
vlan 20
exit
vlan 30
exit
end
```

### 3.2 Create SVI Interfaces (Gateways)

```bash
interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.10.100 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 exit
interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.100 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 exit
interface vlan 30
 ip address 192.168.30.100 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 exit
end
```

### 3.3 Assign Access Ports

```bash
interface g0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
 exit
interface g0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
 exit
interface g0/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 30
 exit
end
```
# Trunk Ports – Theory Explained 

#### 1. What Is a Trunk Port?

A **trunk port** is a switch port that carries traffic for **multiple VLANs** at the same time. While an access port belongs to only one VLAN, a trunk allows many VLANs to travel over a single physical cable.

Think of a trunk like a **highway with multiple lanes**. Each lane represents a VLAN.

---

#### 2. Why Trunks Are Needed

Trunk links are used when you want to send several VLANs across one connection, such as:

* Switch → Switch
* Switch → Router
* Switch → Firewall (FortiGate)
* Switch → VMware/Hyper-V/Proxmox host

Without a trunk, you would need **one physical cable per VLAN**, which is not practical.

Trunking solves this by carrying all VLANs together.

---

#### 3. How Trunks Work (Simple Explanation)

When traffic leaves an access port, it is **untagged** (no VLAN ID). But once it enters a trunk port, the switch adds a **VLAN tag**—a small label inside the Ethernet frame.

This tag includes:

* VLAN ID (10, 20, 30, etc.)
* Priority bits (for QoS)

The receiving switch/firewall reads the tag and delivers the frame to the correct VLAN.

This is called **802.1Q VLAN tagging**.

---

#### 4. Tagged vs. Untagged

* **Tagged** traffic contains a VLAN ID → used on trunk links
* **Untagged** traffic has no VLAN ID → used on access ports

A trunk normally has:

* One **native VLAN** (untagged)
* All other VLANs **tagged**

Example:

* Native VLAN: 10
* Tagged VLANs: 20, 30, 40

---

#### 5. Trunking in our Network

In our topology:

```
Switch g0/0  <—— TRUNK ——>  FortiGate port1
```

The trunk carries:

* VLAN 10
* VLAN 20
* VLAN 30

The FortiGate then uses subinterfaces:

* port1.10
* port1.20
* port1.30

Each subinterface handles traffic tagged for its VLAN.

---

#### 6. Why Trunking Is Essential

Without a trunk, VLAN traffic cannot reach:

* Inter-VLAN routers
* Firewalls
* Other switches

And you would need:

* 3 cables for 3 VLANs
* 10 cables for 10 VLANs

With a trunk → **1 cable carries everything.**

---

#### 7. Benefits of Trunking

✔ Reduces cabling
✔ Allows VLAN expansion across switches
✔ Works perfectly with FortiGate, routers, hypervisors
✔ Supports inter-VLAN routing architectures
✔ Required for enterprise network design

---


#### 8. Trunk Theory in One Sentence

A **trunk port** is a single cable that carries **multiple VLANs**, using **802.1Q tags** so the receiving device knows which VLAN each frame belongs to.

---

### 3.4 Configure TRUNK to FortiGate

```bash
interface g0/0
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
 exit
end
```

### 3.5 Enable Routing

```bash
conf t
ip routing
end
```

---

## 4. FortiGate Configuration

### 4.1 Set Hostname

```bash
config system global
 set hostname FGT
end
```

### 4.2 Configure VLAN Interfaces

#### VLAN 10

```bash
config system interface
 edit "vlan10"
  set interface "port1"
  set vlanid 10
  set ip 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
  set allowaccess ping http https ssh
  set role lan
 next
end
```

#### VLAN 20

```bash
config system interface
 edit "vlan20"
  set interface "port1"
  set vlanid 20
  set ip 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
  set allowaccess ping
  set role lan
 next
end
```

#### VLAN 30

```bash
config system interface
 edit "vlan30"
  set interface "port1"
  set vlanid 30
  set ip 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
  set allowaccess ping
  set role lan
 next
end
```

## 5. Static Routes on FortiGate

### 5.1 Understanding Static Routes in This Network

Static routes are required because the **L3 switch**, not the FortiGate, performs inter-VLAN routing. The switch has **SVI interfaces** for VLAN 10, VLAN 20, and VLAN 30, allowing it to route traffic internally between these networks.

However, the FortiGate only knows routes for networks **directly connected** to its own interfaces. Since **VLAN 20 and VLAN 30 are not directly connected** to the FortiGate, they exist **behind the switch**.

Therefore, we must manually tell the FortiGate:

* **"To reach 192.168.20.0/24, send traffic to the switch at 192.168.10.100."**
* **"To reach 192.168.30.0/24, send traffic to the switch at 192.168.10.100."**

The switch SVI for VLAN 10 (**192.168.10.100**) acts as the **next-hop gateway** for both VLAN 20 and VLAN 30.

Without these static routes:

* The FortiGate would receive traffic from those VLANs,
* But it would have **no return path** back to VLAN 20 or VLAN 30,
* Resulting in failed communication.

These static routes ensure a complete and working **two-way routing path** between all VLANs and the FortiGate.

### 5.3 Packet Flow Animation (Step-by-Step)

#### **PC2 (VLAN 20) → Internet**

```
[1] PC2 sends packet to its gateway (192.168.20.100)
       ↓
[2] L3 Switch routes packet and forwards it to FortiGate (192.168.10.1)
       ↓
[3] FortiGate performs NAT → sends packet out WAN (port2)
       ↓
[4] Internet receives packet
```

---

#### **Internet → PC2 (Return Traffic)**

```
[1] Internet returns packet to FortiGate public IP
       ↓
[2] FortiGate reverse-NATs it back to PC2’s private IP
       ↓
[3] FortiGate sends it to switch (192.168.10.100)
       ↓
[4] Switch routes to VLAN 20 and delivers to PC2
```

---

#### **PC1 (VLAN 30) → PC2 (VLAN 20)**

```
[1] PC1 sends packet to gateway 192.168.30.100
       ↓
[2] L3 Switch routes directly between VLAN30 and VLAN20
       ↓
[3] PC2 receives packet (FortiGate NOT involved)
```


```bash
config router static
 edit 1
  set dst 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0
  set gateway 192.168.10.100
  set device "port1"
 next
 edit 2
  set dst 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0
  set gateway 192.168.10.100
  set device "port1"
 next
end
```

| Static routes added          | ✔      |
| PCs have correct gateway     | ✔      |
| Firewall policy for internet | ✔      |

---

## 11. WAN / ISP Setup

This section configures the ISP/WAN interface on the FortiGate, including DHCP/static IP, NAT, and default routing so internal VLANs can reach the internet.

### 11.1 Configure WAN Interface (port2 example)

```bash
config system interface
    edit "port2"
        set mode dhcp            # If ISP provides IP automatically
        set allowaccess ping
        set role wan
        set alias "WAN"
    next
end
```

If your ISP gives a **static IP**, use:

```bash
config system interface
    edit "port2"
        set mode static
        set ip x.x.x.x y.y.y.y      # Public IP + subnet mask
        set allowaccess ping
        set role wan
    next
end
```

---

### 11.2 Default Route to ISP

FortiGate must forward all outbound traffic to the WAN gateway.

```bash
config router static
    edit 0
        set dst 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
        set gateway x.x.x.x        # ISP gateway
        set device "port2"
    next
end
```

If using DHCP on port2, FortiGate automatically receives the default route.

---

### 11.3 NAT for Internet Access

Your internal VLANs must be NAT’ed out of port2.

```bash
config firewall policy
    edit 10
        set srcintf "vlan10" "vlan20" "vlan30"
        set dstintf "port2"
        set srcaddr all
        set dstaddr all
        set action accept
        set schedule always
        set service ALL
        set nat enable
    next
end
```

---

### 11.4 Test WAN Connectivity

```bash
execute ping 8.8.8.8
execute traceroute 8.8.8.8
```

If ping works, VLAN clients will also reach the internet.

---

### 11.5 Example End-to-End Traffic Flow

```
PC → SVI Gateway (Switch) → FortiGate VLAN10 → NAT on port2 → ISP → Internet
```

---
